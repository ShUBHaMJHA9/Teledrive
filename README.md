## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| **OTP not received** | Make sure phone number includes country code (`+91...`). Check Telegram app — not SMS. |
| **"API ID/Hash invalid"** | Re-copy from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) — no spaces, no quotes |
| **Thumbnails not loading** | File must be synced from Telegram first. Try right-clicking → **Set Thumbnail** |
| **Video won't play** | Browser must support the video codec. Try downloading and playing locally |
| **Share link says "Link Unavailable"** | The token may be wrong. Re-generate via right-click → Share |
| **Upload stuck at 0%** | Check backend is running on port 3000. Check `.env` credentials |
| **Channel not showing files** | Click **Sync from Telegram** button on the Channels page |
| **Can't move files between folders** | Right-click → **Cut** → navigate to target folder → right-click blank area → **Paste** |
| **Search returns nothing** | Search only matches file/folder **names** — not content inside files |
